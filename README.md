# Problem statement:-
Access to timely and reliable healthcare remains a major challenge, especially when individuals are unsure about the severity of their symptoms or where to find trustworthy medical professionals nearby. Many people delay seeking help due to confusion, misinformation, or lack of access to verified doctors — which can worsen their condition.


# objective of the project:-
To address this critical issue , Our team has developed a web application named "HealthMentor".

HealthMentor aims to address the gap of healthcare acccessibility by offering a user-friendly platform that:
- Guides users with preliminary symptom-based insights.
- Recommends nearby verified doctors based on specialization and location.
- Empowers Users with reliable health information to make informed decisions.

By combining a symptom checker with personalised doctor recommendations, HealthMentor enables users to make informed decisions about their health and receive timely care — all from a single, accessible web application.

# Future Scope

HealthMentor has the potential to evolve into a comprehensive digital healthcare assistant. Some future enhancements include:

-  AI-Powered Diagnosis Support: Integrating machine learning models to provide more accurate symptom analysis and predictive diagnosis.
- Telemedicine Integration: Allowing users to book virtual consultations with verified doctors directly through the platform.
- Electronic Health Records (EHR): Enabling users to securely store, access, and share their medical history with healthcare providers.
- Multi-Language Support: Expanding accessibility by offering the platform in multiple regional and international languages.
- Emergency Services: Providing quick access to nearby hospitals, ambulances, and emergency contacts during critical health situations.
- Health & Wellness Tips: Offering personalized health tips, reminders, and wellness programs based on user data.

These additions aim to transform HealthMentor into a holistic health management platform, improving healthcare outcomes and user experience.
